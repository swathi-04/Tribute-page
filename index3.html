                <h1 class="title">Early Life</h1>
                <p>Nicholas James Vujicic, born 4 December 1982, is an Australian American Christian evangelist and motivational speaker born with tetra-amelia syndrome,a rare disorder characterized by the absence of arms and legs.</p>

                <p>He was born without fully formed limbs. According to his
                autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him 
                when the nurse held him in front of her, and she and her 
                husband went out of the hospital.</p>
            
                <p>Originally, the toes of one of his feet were fused. 
                An operation was performed to separate the toes so that 
                he could use them as fingers to grab. He refers to it as 
                his chicken drumstick.</p>
            
                <p>When he was seventeen years old, Vujicic's mother showed 
                him a newspaper article about a woman praying with a severe
                disability; he then started to give talks at his prayer group.
                Vujicic graduated from Griffith University at the age of 21 with
                a Bachelor of Commerce degree, with a double major in accountancy 
                and financial planning.</p>
            
                <p>In 2005, Vujicic founded Life Without Limbs, an international
                non-profit organisation and ministry. In 2007, he founded 
                Attitude is Altitude, a secular motivational speaking company.</p>
                
                <p>Vujicic starred in the short film The Butterfly Circus. At the 
                2010 Method Fest Independent Film Festival, he was awarded Best
                 Actor in a Short Film for his starring performance as well.</p></div>
